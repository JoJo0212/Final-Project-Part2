### Feedback on the recent version

**Reader 1. Student, mid 20’s**

*How do you feel about the whole story line?*

I think the story line is pretty good, starting from your own perspective of how you are connected to this aricle and then delves into the more substantial aspects involving facts and data.

*Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?*

I'm quite surprised by the statistics on meat production. Initially, I anticipated a higher percentage for beef production and hadn't considered that it's on a decreasing trend.

*Is this project helping you understanding how meat consumption will change our world? Does it encourage you to consume less meat?*

It certainly aids in my comprehension of how meat consumption affects our world. While I'm not deeply immersed in this topic, the insights are valuable. However, I may stick to my original eating habits for now.

*Is there anything you would change or do differently?*  

I believe it would enhance the narrative flow if the sections on meat production and meat consumption were switched. Placing meat consumption first might grab readers' attention more effectively, as it directly relates to them.

*How do you feel about the whole story line?*

I think it's well-structured, and I can tell this is something that you really cares about. 

*Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?*

I think I'm surprised by a lot of stuff and facts in the article as this is not a topic that I usually cares.

*Is this project helping you understanding how meat consumption will change our world? Does it encourage you to consume less meat?*

It kind of boarden my horizon on this topic, I will try to avoid meat once a week from now on.

*Is there anything you would change or do differently?*  

I think it will be nice if there are some comparison of how those weight equals, for example, I know 200 million tonnes is a huge numer, but I cannot really relate to how much does it weight, if there is a picture or a note saying something like 200 million tonnes equals to a thousand airplanes (just blindly guessing) I can picture how much is that.

*How do you feel about the whole story line?*

I think it went smoothly, it effectively communicates the urgency and relevance of the issue.

*Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?*

It's shocked to know how much meat we eat in a year.

*Is this project helping you understanding how meat consumption will change our world? Does it encourage you to consume less meat?*

The report is enlightening, offering a comprehensive understanding of the global impact of meat consumption. While it hasn't led to an immediate change in my eating habits, I will try to consider more when eating.

*Is there anything you would change or do differently?*  

I would wish to see more picture in this article as there are a lot of words and graphs already in the article, and I think adding some pictures can make the whole reading process more interesting.
